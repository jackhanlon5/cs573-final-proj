Inspired by
[Simulated COVID maps in the US and Canada](https://vizhub.com/almccon/fbb34859ee724a2ab20b5aca60f69fb5)

Final version of the map! So happy to have fully revamped
this and make it work! MEM (Memphis Grizzlies) are a massive
statistical issue for me to plot here as they had an absurd
number of injuries during this season, and thus had
significantly more players than the rest of the league.
Because of this, they hurt the scale and had to be removed
from the map. If I had more time I would try to figure
something out or get some new data for this, but since the
semester is over I can't. Cool project for someone to pick
up, would also recommend this as a template as the
development of it was a huge challenge.

"MEM": [35.1495, -90.049], Line to add back into
"team_locations.json" to get MEM back!
