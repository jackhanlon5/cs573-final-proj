Inspired mostly by
[Simulated COVID maps in the US and Canada](https://vizhub.com/almccon/fbb34859ee724a2ab20b5aca60f69fb5)

Looks significantly better in full screen, couldn't get this
to look nice in the small viewer window, will try to iron it
out as the semester goes on. Same goes with the teams
overlapping. Added the selector to initially combat this
issue. Mainly wanted to test the visualization before I went
head first and actually developed it!
